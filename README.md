# Recursive-Descent-Parser---Mini-Language
This application implements a recursive-descent parser for a mini programming language that supports:  - If-else statements  - Variable assignments with arithmetic operators  - Sequential statement execution  - The parser validates input code against a formal context-free grammar (CFG) and reports whether the syntax is valid.
